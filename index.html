        <h2>What is the Stock Market?</h2>
        <p>The stock market is a financial marketplace where companies raise capital by selling shares, and investors buy and sell these shares to generate returns. In India, it is regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) to ensure fair trading practices.</p>
        <p>There are two major stock exchanges in India:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NSE (National Stock Exchange):</strong> The largest stock exchange in India, known for its Nifty 50 index.</li>
            <li><strong>BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange):</strong> The oldest stock exchange in Asia, home to the Sensex index.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: If you buy 10 shares of Reliance Industries at â‚¹2,500 per share, you own a part of Reliance and can benefit from its growth through capital appreciation and dividends.</p>
