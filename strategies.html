        <h2>Why Investment Strategies Matter?</h2>
        <p>Investing without a strategy is like driving without a map. Having a structured approach helps investors maximize returns, reduce risks, and stay disciplined during market fluctuations.</p>
        <p>A well-planned investment strategy considers factors like risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.</p>

        <h2>Popular Investment Strategies</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Value Investing</h3>
        <p>Value investing focuses on finding stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value. Investors analyze financial statements, debt levels, and future growth potential.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Principles:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy stocks when they are undervalued.</li>
            <li>Hold them long-term until they reach their true value.</li>
            <li>Use financial ratios like P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and ROE to assess stocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Buying HDFC Bank shares in 2008 during the global financial crisis and holding them for over a decade, yielding massive returns.</p>

        <h3>2. Growth Investing</h3>
        <p>Growth investors look for companies with high earnings growth potential, even if their stocks seem expensive. These companies reinvest profits into expansion rather than paying dividends.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Indicators:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>High revenue and earnings growth rates.</li>
            <li>Competitive advantages (e.g., technology innovation).</li>
            <li>Expanding market share.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Investing in companies like Infosys in the early 2000s when the IT sector in India was booming.</p>
